# Nested Learning
This repository provides an early skeleton for a PyPI-ready library that will
implement the Nested Learning paradigm and the HOPE (self-modifying) continual
learning system described in "Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning
Architecture" by Ali Behrouz et al.

## Install (skeleton)
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quick start (skeleton)
```python
from nestedlearning import ContinuumMemory, HopeTrainer, NestedOptimizer, SelfModifyingModel

# Implement concrete subclasses before use.
```
